## How to Play

### Objective
Roll dice to meet or exceed target scores across increasingly difficult rounds. Earn money based on your performance and spend it on additional dice to improve your chances.

### Controls
- **Double-tap** or click **Roll Dice** button to throw the dice
- **Click on individual dice** to lock/unlock them (locked dice won't reroll)
- Locked dice show a ðŸ”’ indicator

### Game Mechanics

#### Rounds
- Each round has a target score you must reach
- You have 3 rerolls per round to achieve the target
- Target scores increase with each round: 7, 12, 18, 25, 33, 42...

#### Scoring & Earnings
Complete a round to earn money based on:
- **Base earnings**: Score minus target score
- **Perfect Roll Bonus**: +$10 for hitting the exact target
- **Efficiency Bonus**: +$2 per unused reroll

#### Store
Between rounds, spend your earnings on:
- **Extra Dice**: Starting at $10, price increases by 50% with each purchase
- More dice = higher potential scores

### Strategy Tips
- Lock high-value dice to preserve good rolls
- Balance risk vs reward - perfect rolls give bonuses but are harder to achieve
- Save rerolls when possible for efficiency bonuses
- Buy additional dice to make higher targets achievable
